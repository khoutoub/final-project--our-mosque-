            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in 2007, Halal Mosque has been a beacon of faith and community in Indianapolis IN. What started as a small gathering of believers in a rented hall has blossomed into a vibrant community center that welcomes hundreds of worshippers each week. Over the years, we have expanded our facilities and programs to meet the growing needs of our diverse community.
